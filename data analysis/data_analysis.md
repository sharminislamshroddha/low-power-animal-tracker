# Turtle Data Logger Analysis

This report shows a simple analysis of turtle movement data. The data was collected using a small device attached to a turtle. We used Python and Google Colab to do the analysis.

## 📓 Google Colab Notebook

## 🕒 Data Collection Period

- **Start Date & Time:** May 2, 2025 at 16:00:01 (approximately, ±1 hour)  
- **End Date & Time:** May 10, 2025 at 03:19:44 (approximately, ±1 hour)  

This means the data was recorded over a period of around 8 days.

## 📈 Acceleration Time Series Visualization

The chart below shows the turtle’s movement using acceleration magnitude. The x-axis represents the sample index (each sample is one data point recorded over time). Spikes in the graph show active movement, while flat areas mean less or no movement.
